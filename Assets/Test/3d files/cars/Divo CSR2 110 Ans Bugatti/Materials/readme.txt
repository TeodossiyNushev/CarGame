2020 Bugatti Divo "CSR2 110 Ans Bugatti"

Info
The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept
in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned exhaust system featuring quad
exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the
roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more
refined side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes.

The interior in the Divo is relatively similar to the more luxurious Chiron, but has Alcantara upholstery and carbon-fibre trim in order to save weight.

Other notable changes include stiffer springs and dampers, carbon-fibre wiper blades and intercooler shroud, grooved wheel spokes, reduced sound
insulation, a lighter sound system and removal of the storage lockers present in the doors and centre console for a weight saving of 35 kg (77 lb) over the Chiron Sport.
The engine, a quad-turbocharged W16 unit, is retained from the Chiron along with the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.
