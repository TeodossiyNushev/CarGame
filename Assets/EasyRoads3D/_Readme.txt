Thank you for purchasing EasyRoads3D Pro

This package includes the EasyRoads3D Pro tool and two simple demo scenes

1) Scene Main: a small road network and a road through hills following the terrain contours.

2) Scene runtime: in play mode a road is created and afterwards an object follows the road 


It is recommended to spend some time getting familiar with the tool before starting to use it in your projects. 

The manual is located in the EasyRoads3D root directory. The first pages of the manual explain the main workflow.

An additional free demo project is available here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/easyroads3d-demo-project-105045

It is recommended to import in a new project first. It can be imported in your project 
if you want to use all assets. Otherwise assets can be exported / imported. 

It includes featured zones with links to tutorials on our website, http://easyroads3d.com/tutorials.php. 

The demo project also includes a variety of different road types and side objects which can be used in 
your own personal and commercial projects except for asset store packages.

Please contact us for permission to use these assets in Unity asset store packages or for example open source Unity projects.   

The legacy provisional beta demo project is part of the demo project as a separate Unity package.
